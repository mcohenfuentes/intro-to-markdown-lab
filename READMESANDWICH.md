How to make a PB&J is a highly personal experience. The steps below are what I think makes an excellent PB&J.

## Ingredients 
* 2 slices of bread (**sourdough** is my favorite)
* Peanut butter (**smooth** is great but *crunchy* is fun)
* Jelly (**raspberry** adds a nice tang)

### Here is how my variables would look
```Javascript
let breadSlice1 = "üçû";
let breadSlice2 = "üçû";
let peanutButter = "ü•ú";
let jelly = "üçá";
```
## Instructions 
1. Toast bread (unless you're working with freshly baked bread)

2. Lay your two slices out side by side 

3. Spread the Peanut Butter 
    1. scoop a generous amount onto a knife and spread it evenly making sure to cover all the ***edges*** of **BOTH** slices of bread.

4. Spread the Jelly
    1. Use a different knife to scoop the jelly and spread it evenly only on **ONE** slice of bread. 

5. Assemble the Sandwich
    1. Gently place the jelly covered slice on top of the peanut butter-covered slice

6. Slice diagonally to make fun *triangle* slices

## Enjoy!

Serve immediately or pack it for later. If taking it to go, wrap it in foil, plastic wrap, or a sandwich bag to keep it fresh.
